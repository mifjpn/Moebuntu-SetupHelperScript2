<p>Moebuntu Setup Helper Script for Repository:Moebuntu-kawaiiUbuntu-ToysOriginal</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-this-setup-helper">1.Overview of this setup helper</h2>
<p>This setup helper is for the ”<a href="https://github.com/mifjpn/Moebuntu-kawaiiUbuntu-ToysOriginal">mifjpn/Moebuntu-kawaiiUbuntu-ToysOriginal</a>’’ repository.<br>
The repository has a collection of nine moe (or kawaii) color themes.<br>
In addition, it also includes a Moe (or Kawaii) theme for Plymouth (ie the screen when the OS loads).<br>
And also include a Moe (or Kawaii) Sounds.<br>
This setup helper is intended to make setting them up easier.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">2.How to use</h2>
<h3 id="operating-system-environment-download-and-preparation.">1)Operating system environment, download and preparation.</h3>
<p>Please prepare “UBUNTU22.04Lts”.<br>
This script should work on this OS.<br>
First, download the release “scripts.tar.xz” with firefox.<br>
Then unpack this file with “Archive Manager” etc.<br>
Once the “scripts” folder is unpacked, you’ll find the helper scripts in there.</p>
<h3 id="explanation-of-the-simplest-usage">2)Explanation of the simplest usage</h3>
<p>In the “Nautilus” file manager, open the “script” folder.<br>
Among many shell scripts, the script to run is “Moeset”.<br>
The easiest way is to right click on this “Moeset” and run it with “Run as a Program”.<br>
When the script runs, “Moebuntu Setting Helper” will appear.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-moebuntu-setting-helper">3)How to use “Moebuntu Setting Helper”</h3>
<p>You can see the selection screen of many setup items.<br>
Here, the first setup item you must do is “1) base setting(Do first!)”.<br>
The “gnome-shell-extension-manager” window will open. What to do here is given as instructions from this helper. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for “User Themes” in the “Browse” tab</li>
<li>Click the “Add” button to install</li>
<li>Go to the Added tab and activate the Extension by setting the button on the header to “ON” (to the right)</li>
<li>turn on the button to the right of “User Themes”<br>
(Then please push Window-close button and close this window)</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all there is to do here.<br>
(Because: The reason for manipulating the GUI in this way is so that Gnome-Shell-Extension will properly react to changes in GNOME versions.)</p>
<p>Numbers 2) to 10) of choice are setups of 9 color “themes” that are each “Window Theme and Shell Theme Set”.<br>
In those settings, you can change the login screen.<br>
If you want to change, type “Y” to the “Change login screen” question.<br>
If you want to change to Moebuntu basic login screen, type “Y” to the “Set Moebuntu basic login picture(Y)<br>
Or Original(or Example) login png-picture(N)?:” question.<br>
If You choose “N” for Original or Example login image,<br>
A question for inputting image in PNG format for changes will appear.<br>
If you have a png image file you want to change, drag and drop it from nautilus file manager. If you press return without entering anything,you ask “Apply the cute image of anime-style Metan-chan (Reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake-Japan’s Great Disaster-Character)?(Y/N)” and you press Y,the cute metan-chan image will be specified.</p>
<p>If you choose “11) remove Moe-theme”, the 9-color theme file of Moebuntu will be deleted, and the default setting of “Yaru” will be restored.</p>
<p>The choices for “12) and 13)” are items to set or remove Moe-Pink-Icon (kawaii icons).</p>
<p>“14) set Moe-spinner plymouth” is a setting item of Moe (Kawaii) plymouth (OS loading waiting screen).<br>
If you want to set Moebuntu basic screen image, type “Y” in “Set Moebuntu basic plymouse screen image (Y)<br>
Or Set Original(or Example) plymouth png-file(N)?:”.<br>
If you choose “N” for using the original PNG image file as a plymouth image, drag and drop the PNG image file from the nautilus file manager.<br>
If you press the return key without entering anything,you ask “Apply the cute image of anime-style Metan-chan (Reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake-Japan’s Great Disaster-Character)?(Y/N)” and you press Y,the cute metan-chan image will be specified.<br>
(Note that the PNG image will be displayed in tiles. If you want a single image, you must match the resolution of your display.)<br>
“15) remove Moe-spinner plymouth” sets back to the default Plymouth where the default “UBUNTU spinner” is displayed.</p>
<p>The "16) ‘’ choices are used to switch the example background of the screen to a Moe image(Kawaii image)  pasting the "Moebuntu logo’’</p>
<p>You will be asked “Please drag-and-drop wall jpg-file or push to set return (Example):”, so if you want to change the desktop wallpaper,drag and drop the JPG image file from the nautilus file manager.<br>
If you press the return key without entering anything,you ask “Apply the cute image of anime-style Metan-chan (Reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake-Japan’s Great Disaster-Character)?(Y/N)” and you press Y,the cute metan-chan image will be specified.</p>
<p>If you choose “17)”, the background will return to the default background screen of “UBUNTU”.</p>
<p>Choices 18) and 19) are used for Firefox to be the Deb version or the Snap version. The Deb version of Firefox can run with a Moe (Kawaii) theme.</p>
<p>Choices 20)~23) are used to set sounds (each version)<br>
Example version iori is made by aminetion amatur voice actor.<br>
Example version maid iori is maid-version of iori.<br>
Example version SF iori is SF-version of iori.<br>
Example version MGd is made whth Hatsune-Miku voice.</p>
<p>Choices 24) are used to remove Moe-sound all.</p>
<h2 id="known-errors">3. Known Errors</h2>
<p>In some parts of UBUNTU on Virtual-Box, there is a problem that the user-theme cannot be created. However, it was not possible to reproduce. If this happens, you should either set the theme with “Gnome Tweaks” or reboot.</p>
<h2 id="about-forking-and-improving-this-moebuntu-setup-helper">4.About forking and improving this “Moebuntu Setup Helper”</h2>
<p>This script is basically MIT licensed. So I think it would be nice to fork, for example, to create a local language version.<br>
But the themes, Plymouth, and Icons are made by Toy.<br>
Therefore, please create a script that downloads them from GitHub. (Do not include works such as Toy’s theme in scripts.)</p>
